# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've tested the Teacher Analytics API endpoints and found a critical issue affecting multiple endpoints. The problem is a mismatch in data structure - the analytics endpoints are looking for students with a class_id field in their profile, but when students join a class, the class ID is added to a joined_classes array instead. This causes the endpoints to not find any students in the class, resulting in 403 Access Denied errors for the detailed test results and class performance endpoints. The overview endpoint works in terms of returning a 200 response, but it shows empty data due to the same issue. The authorization checks are working correctly - students are properly denied access to teacher endpoints, and teachers can't access other teachers' classes. To fix this issue, the analytics endpoints need to be updated to look for class IDs in the joined_classes array instead of a class_id field."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Upon investigation, I found that the analytics endpoints already correctly use 'joined_classes' array. However, there are two issues: 1) The analytics endpoints are missing ObjectId serialization using convert_objectid_to_str function causing 500 errors, and 2) There may be authentication/authorization logic issues causing 403 errors. I will fix the ObjectId serialization first and then debug the 403 errors."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've tested the Teacher Analytics API endpoints after the fixes and all endpoints are now working correctly. The issue was indeed related to ObjectId serialization. The endpoints were correctly using the joined_classes array to find students in classes, but were failing due to MongoDB ObjectId objects not being properly serialized to JSON. The fix involved adding convert_objectid_to_str calls in the identify_struggling_topics function and throughout the class performance endpoint. All three analytics endpoints now return 200 OK responses with the expected data structure. The authorization checks are also working correctly - students are properly denied access to teacher endpoints, and teachers can't access other teachers' classes."
