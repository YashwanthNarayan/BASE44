# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

          comment: "The /api/teacher/analytics/test-results endpoint is not working correctly. The endpoint returns 403 Access Denied errors when filtering by class_id or student_id. The issue is in the query logic - it's looking for students with a class_id field in their profile, but when students join a class, the class ID is added to a joined_classes array instead. This mismatch in data structure is causing the endpoint to not find any students in the class, resulting in access denied errors."

          comment: "The /api/teacher/analytics/class-performance/{class_id} endpoint is not working correctly. It returns a 403 Access Denied error even for valid class IDs. The issue is the same as with the test results endpoint - it's looking for students with a class_id field in their profile, but students have class IDs in a joined_classes array instead. This mismatch prevents the endpoint from finding students in the class."

The endpoint returns empty arrays for class_summary and subject_distribution."

    message: "I've implemented a complete Notes Generation system in the backend with the following features: 1) Notes generation API for creating comprehensive, summary, and quick reference notes for different subjects, 2) Notes management APIs for retrieving, filtering, and searching notes, 3) Actions for favoriting and deleting notes, 4) Database operations for storing notes, 5) Error handling for invalid inputs, and 6) A NotesGeneratorBot class that generates high-quality, subject-specific notes. Please test all these components thoroughly."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've completed testing of the Notes Generation system. The notes generation functionality works well - students can generate notes for different subjects and topics, and the content is high-quality and relevant. The DELETE operation for notes also works correctly. However, there's an issue with the notes management APIs (/api/notes, /api/notes/{note_id}) which are returning 500 Internal Server Error. The error logs show a problem with MongoDB ObjectId serialization: 'ObjectId' object is not iterable. This is likely because the notes are stored with MongoDB's native ObjectId but not properly converted to string IDs in the API response. This issue needs to be fixed for the notes management functionality to work properly. Also, the API currently accepts empty topics, which might not be intended behavior and could be improved with validation."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've completed re-testing of the Notes Management system after the ObjectId serialization fix. All tests are now passing successfully. The notes management APIs (/api/notes, /api/notes/{note_id}) are working correctly and returning proper JSON responses. The ObjectId serialization issue has been fixed, and all MongoDB ObjectIds are properly converted to strings in the API responses. I've verified the complete notes workflow including generating notes, retrieving the notes list, viewing individual note details, favoriting/unfavoriting notes, and deleting notes. All these operations work as expected. The only minor issue is that the API still accepts empty topics, which might not be intended behavior, but this doesn't affect the core functionality. Data integrity is maintained, and student isolation is working correctly (students only see their own notes). The system is now fully functional."
