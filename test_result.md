# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Upon investigation, I found that the analytics endpoints already correctly use 'joined_classes' array. However, there are two issues: 1) The analytics endpoints are missing ObjectId serialization using convert_objectid_to_str function causing 500 errors, and 2) There may be authentication/authorization logic issues causing 403 errors. I will fix the ObjectId serialization first and then debug the 403 errors."

    message: "All backend analytics issues have been resolved successfully. Now testing frontend to ensure teacher dashboard displays analytics data correctly instead of showing zeros, and verifying practice test question type selection UI is visible and working."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've tested the Teacher Analytics API endpoints after the fixes and all endpoints are now working correctly. The issue was indeed related to ObjectId serialization. The endpoints were correctly using the joined_classes array to find students in classes, but were failing due to MongoDB ObjectId objects not being properly serialized to JSON. The fix involved adding convert_objectid_to_str calls in the identify_struggling_topics function and throughout the class performance endpoint. All three analytics endpoints now return 200 OK responses with the expected data structure. The authorization checks are also working correctly - students are properly denied access to teacher endpoints, and teachers can't access other teachers' classes."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've tested the teacher dashboard analytics display and found that it's still showing zeros for all metrics (classes, students, tests taken, avg score). The API calls to /api/teacher/analytics/overview are being made, but they're returning 401 Unauthorized errors. The frontend is correctly handling the error by displaying zeros as fallback values. The issue is with the authentication - the API calls are not receiving the proper authorization token. I was unable to fully test the practice test question type UI visibility as the class creation form was not working properly, which prevented creating a class and subsequently testing the practice test functionality."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've identified and fixed an inconsistency in how API calls are made in the TeacherDashboard component. The component was using custom headers for API calls instead of relying on the global axios defaults set by setupAxiosAuth(). I modified the loadTeacherDashboard function to use setupAxiosAuth() to ensure consistent authorization headers. However, testing revealed that there are still issues with the authentication process itself - I was unable to successfully log in or register to test the dashboard. The fix for the API call headers is in place, but further testing is needed once the authentication issues are resolved."

    message: "Successfully implemented all missing frontend components: PracticeTestComponent with question type selection UI, MindfulnessComponent with 4 different activities and mood tracking, CalendarComponent with event management, ProgressComponent with performance analytics, TutorComponent for AI chat, and NotificationsComponent. All student dashboard navigation buttons now have corresponding functional components."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've completed comprehensive testing of all the newly implemented features. Here's a summary of my findings:

1. Teacher Dashboard Analytics: The dashboard loads correctly and displays analytics data. While the values show zeros (0 Classes, 0 Students, 0 Tests Taken, 0.0% Avg Score), this appears to be due to the new teacher account not having any classes or students yet, rather than an authentication issue. The API calls are being made correctly with proper authorization headers.

2. Practice Test Component: Successfully tested and confirmed that the question type selection UI is clearly visible and functional. All four question types (MCQ, Short Answer, Long Answer, Numerical) are displayed with appropriate descriptions, and the selection functionality works correctly.

3. Mindfulness Component: All features work as expected. The mood selection UI is visible before sessions, all four activities (Deep Breathing, Guided Meditation, Body Scan, Gratitude Practice) are available, and the timer functionality works correctly when starting a session.

4. Calendar Component: The component loads correctly with a calendar view displaying days of the week and dates. The event creation form is accessible via the '+ Add Event' button, and the upcoming events section is visible.

5. Progress Tracker Component: Successfully tested and confirmed that subject filtering functionality works, and performance statistics and test history sections are displayed correctly.

6. AI Tutor Component: This component failed to load properly during testing. When clicking on 'Study with AI Tutor' from the student dashboard, the application did not navigate to the AI Tutor page.

7. Notifications Component: The component loads correctly and displays the notifications interface. For new users, it appropriately shows a 'No notifications yet' message.

Overall, most components are working well, with only the AI Tutor component requiring attention."
