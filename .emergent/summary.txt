The AI engineer successfully guided the  application through multiple significant feature enhancements and critical bug fixes. Initially, the focus was on a pervasive authentication issue, followed by a pivot to specific user-requested features. Key milestones include the development of a Smart Calendar Bot with Pomodoro integration and real-time synchronization, a complete overhaul and implementation of the Notes feature with proper markdown and mathematical rendering, and the creation of an AI-powered Smart Spaced Repetition system for practice tests. Each major feature involved extensive full-stack development, from new backend endpoints and AI service logic to frontend components, UI adjustments, and dynamic data handling. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in debugging complex issues, including MongoDB ObjectId serialization errors and intricate AI parsing logic. The work concluded with debugging a submission issue for scheduled tests, indicating a focus on robust user experience and backend data integrity.

The  application is a nearly complete full-stack educational platform (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) that began by resolving a critical 401 Unauthorized error preventing test generation. The user's explicit requests and the problem statement driving development are:

1.  **Authentication Stability**: Ensure robust login and session management, eliminating Authentication expired issues.
2.  **Enhanced Progress Tracking**: Display all practice test data and enable detailed question-by-question review upon clicking assessments.
3.  **AI Chatbot Evolution**: Implement conversational memory, chat management, high-quality message formatting (markdown, LaTeX), and transform the AI chatbot into a guided, teacher-like entity that understands student patterns and avoids direct solutions.
4.  **Mindfulness Enhancement**: Improve the basic mindfulness feature with diverse activities, background sounds, progress tracking, and personalization.
5.  **Teacher Dashboard Functionality**: Resolve 500 errors and ensure accurate display of class management and detailed student analytics (test scores, class performance).
6.  **Terminology Refinement**: Replace neural and quantum jargon with conventional educational terms.
7.  **New Feature (In-progress)**: Integrate practice test results with the chatbot for guided corrections, focusing on incorrect answers and tracking strengths/weaknesses.
8.  **Smart Calendar Bot**: Develop a bot that designs personalized study sessions using the Pomodoro technique, based on student input (e.g., duration, subjects).
9.  **Real-Time Calendar Bot**: Ensure the study planner integrates with the actual computer time for session scheduling and tracking.
10. **Practice Test Smart Evaluation**: Enable the AI to check short/long answers based on content meaning, not just exact matches, and fix white font in answer inputs.
11. **Smart Spaced Repetition**: Implement an AI-powered system to automatically schedule the next practice test based on student performance (e.g., higher scores mean longer review intervals).
12. **Calendar Integration for Scheduled Tests**: Display scheduled practice tests on the calendar component.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing an issue where clicking the Complete Review button after a scheduled practice test resulted in a Failed to submit test. Please try again. error.

This problem manifested as a  error on the  endpoint, indicating a **validation error** with the request data format. The AI engineer identified that the frontend was likely sending data that did not perfectly match the backend's  Pydantic model structure.

Prior to this specific issue, the engineer had successfully implemented the core smart spaced repetition system, including:
1.  A new backend route () and database collection ().
2.  Integration of smart scheduling logic into  to determine optimal review times based on test scores.
3.  Automatic scheduling of the next test after a practice test submission ().
4.  Frontend components () to display upcoming tests.
5.  Calendar integration () to show scheduled tests.
6.  The backend also introduced a new endpoint () and updated the  model in  to include , allowing questions to be embedded directly in the submission request.

The current challenge is to diagnose and fix the precise data mismatch that leads to the 422 error, ensuring the  from the frontend aligns perfectly with the backend's expectations for scheduled test submissions.
