The previous AI engineer successfully established the  educational platform, addressing initial critical issues like 500/403 errors in teacher analytics and practice test generation, and undertaking a major refactoring of the codebase. The work then shifted to enhancing core functionalities and UI. A primary focus was the AI Chatbot (). The engineer implemented backend routes and frontend components for chat history, new chats, and deletion, while resolving critical authentication issues. Significant effort was dedicated to improving the chatbot's message formatting, integrating markdown and LaTeX rendering, and enhancing conversation context for better AI responses. Concurrently, the UI underwent multiple iterations, evolving from a cyberpunk theme to a professional, enterprise-grade look, then to a futuristic luxury aesthetic, which subsequently required modularizing the CSS to fix global UI issues. The latest work involved simplifying the design to a simple and very premium aesthetic and replacing gold accents with platinum/silver, addressing user feedback for a less flashy appearance. Throughout, the engineer rigorously performed backend and frontend testing to ensure stability and functionality.

<product_requirements>
The  application is a full-stack educational platform (React, FastAPI, MongoDB), currently 95% complete. The overarching goal is to expand functionality and refine existing features. Initial requirements included: fixing error generating tests (401 Unauthorized), enhancing progress tracking with detailed test results, optimizing deployment costs using free-tier Gemini API (in-memory caching), enabling AI chatbot conversation memory, preventing repeated practice test questions, allowing question type selection, fixing Teacher Dashboard analytics (500 errors, accurate data display), evolving UI from standard to cyberpunk, then professional/enterprise, and implementing core views (Mindfulness, Calendar, AI Tutor, Notes, Notifications, Class Management).

The recent focus, initiated by the current user, is to bring all features to top quality. Specifically for the AI Chatbot, the user requested:
*   A conversational flow with context memory.
*   Functionality for viewing previous chats, initiating new chats, and deleting chats.
*   High-quality message formatting, including proper rendering of special characters, highlighting, markdown, and mathematical (LaTeX) expressions.
*   Iterative UI redesign for the chatbot: from a base professional look to a futuristic cyberpunk, then futuristic luxury, followed by a simple and very premium aesthetic, with a recent request to replace gold accents with another premium color.
