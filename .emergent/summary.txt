The AI engineer's work began by integrating NCERT book units and a grade selector into the . This involved updating  and . Initial issues with AI question relevancy were addressed by refining prompts and expanding fallback question banks, but later traced to a Gemini API quota limit and aggressive caching, which were resolved by using Gemini 1.5 Flash, adding error handling, expanding fallbacks, and ultimately disabling caching for practice questions. Subsequently, a major UI overhaul was performed, adopting a clean, minimalist design inspired by Toddle AI with a purple/indigo color scheme and Inter font. This involved creating numerous  components, a new CSS design system, and a modern navigation bar. Further UI refinements included removing dashboard stats and replacing colorful emojis with subtle, monotone icons across the application. The latest work identified and fixed navigation issues (e.g., page not found for practice tests) and authentication prop mismatches. The current task involves addressing failed to load data errors in modern components by correcting frontend API endpoint paths in , specifically for  and now .

11. **UI/UX Redesign**: Implement a modern, minimalist UI inspired by Toddle AI with a specific color scheme.
12. **UI Simplification**: Remove dashboard stats (XP, tests taken, avg score, study streak) and replace colorful emojis with subtle, monotone icons.
13. **Bug Fix**: Resolve instances of AI generating irrelevant questions despite unit selection.
14. **Bug Fix**: Resolve page not found error for practice tests.
15. **Bug Fix**: Resolve failed to load data in various modern components.

- Fix data loading issues for modern components by correcting frontend API endpoint paths in . The current focus is on the  endpoints.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a bug reported by the user: failed to load the data and stuff for several features. After comprehensive backend testing, it was determined that the backend APIs were functioning correctly, but the frontend components were calling incorrect endpoint paths.

The engineer identified the discrepancies and began rectifying the  file in the frontend. The  object was successfully updated to point to the correct endpoints, for example,  and  now correctly use  and , respectively, instead of previously misconfigured paths.

The work is currently focused on fixing the  endpoints within the same  file. The last action in the trajectory was the AI engineer trying to locate the relevant section for notes API calls within  to correct their paths, ensuring data loads properly in the modern .
