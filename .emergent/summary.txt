The previous AI engineer successfully brought the  educational platform from 0 to 1, resolving critical issues and implementing significant features. Initial work focused on fixing a persistent 500 error in teacher analytics due to missing MongoDB ObjectId serialization and resolving 403 errors by ensuring proper JWT authentication in backend endpoints. Concurrently, the practice test generation feature was enhanced by correcting a deprecated Gemini API model and fixing its own authentication issues on both frontend and backend.

A major architectural achievement involved refactoring the monolithic  and  into modular, component-based structures, significantly improving maintainability and scalability. The engineer also addressed missing core views (Mindfulness, Calendar, AI Tutor, Notifications, My Classes) by implementing placeholder components and ensuring correct navigation. The most prominent work involved a multi-phase UI redesign, transitioning from a basic interface to an immersive cyberpunk theme, then refining it to a professional, enterprise-grade aesthetic with improved typography, spacing, and rounded edges. The final immediate task was to fully re-verify the practice test functionality, which concluded successfully. The current standing request is to polish all features to top quality.

<product_requirements>
The  application is a full-stack educational platform, 95% complete, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The initial goal was to understand the existing codebase (on  branch) and then implement improvements and fixes.

Specific product requirements and implemented features include:
*   **Fixing Practice Test Generation:** Resolve error generating tests (401 Unauthorized) by ensuring JWT authentication.
*   **Enhancing Progress Tracking:** Display practice test scores and results, including subject-specific views, detailed history, and individual question breakdowns.
*   **Deployment Cost Optimization:** Adapt the application to use the free tier of the Gemini API (achieved by implementing in-memory caching).
*   **Chatbot Conversation Memory:** Enable the AI chatbot to remember context for more coherent responses.
*   **Preventing Repeated Practice Test Questions & Question Type Selection:** Ensure unique questions per test and allow selection of question types (MCQ, Short Answer, Numerical, Long Answer).
*   **Fixing Teacher Dashboard Analytics:** Correct errors to display accurate data beyond just average scores, including a 500 error related to data retrieval.
*   **UI Redesign:** Evolve the user interface from a standard design to a futuristic cyberpunk theme, and then further refine it to a professional, enterprise-grade aesthetic.
*   **Implementing Missing Core Features:** Integrate components for Mindfulness, Calendar, AI Tutor, Notes, Notifications, and Class Management.
