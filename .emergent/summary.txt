<analysis>
The AI engineer's work on  initially focused on a persistent, multifaceted authentication issue that repeatedly resurfaced due to misconfigurations in frontend Axios, environment variables, and incorrect token handling (JSON.stringify adding quotes). This involved numerous debugging loops, often requiring reconciliation between backend functionality (confirmed via ) and frontend client-side issues (Axios vs. native fetch, interceptor logic). Once authentication was stabilized, the engineer pivoted to feature enhancements, including fixing inconsistent progress data (null subjects in DB), making detailed test results clickable, enhancing the basic mindfulness feature into a comprehensive wellness platform, fixing teacher dashboard analytics (wrong database collection, missing endpoints), and removing confusing neural/quantum terminology. The most recent work involves transforming the AI chatbot into a more guided, teacher-like entity and integrating practice test corrections into the chatbot.

<product_requirements>
The  application is a full-stack educational platform built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, nearing completion (95%). The core problem initially was a critical 401 Unauthorized error, preventing test generation.
Key requirements include:
1.  **Authentication Stability**: Resolve persistent Authentication expired and login issues.
2.  **Enhanced Progress Tracking**: Display all practice test data (not just math) and enable a detailed question-by-question view upon clicking assessments.
3.  **AI Chatbot Evolution**: Implement conversational memory, chat management (view/new/delete), high-quality message formatting (markdown, LaTeX), and transform it into a guided AI teacher that understands student patterns and avoids direct solutions.
4.  **Mindfulness Enhancement**: Improve the basic mindfulness feature with more activities, background sounds, progress tracking, and personalization.
5.  **Teacher Dashboard Functionality**: Fix 500 errors and ensure accurate display of class management and detailed student analytics (practice test scores, class performance).
6.  **Terminology Refinement**: Remove confusing neural and quantum jargon, replacing it with conventional educational terms.
7.  **New Feature (In-progress)**: Integrate practice test results with the chatbot for guided corrections, focusing on incorrect answers and tracking strengths/weaknesses.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a new major enhancement: enabling the AI chatbot to analyze practice test results and provide conversational corrections to students.

The specific steps being worked on are:
1.  **Add Get Help with Mistakes button** to the practice test results view in .
2.  Once this button is clicked, the system should:
    *   Initiate a conversation with the AI chatbot.
    *   Focus **only on questions the student answered incorrectly**.
    *   Engage in a **conversational, teacher-like manner**, asking the student what they think went wrong to guide their understanding.
    *   **Continue this conversation within the student's current subject chat session** to maintain context.

The AI engineer has already started implementing the Get Help with Mistakes button in . This involves modifying the JSX to include the button and hooking up its functionality to trigger the next steps of the conversational correction flow.
